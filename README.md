## Subtitle Generator (enhanced)

Thanks [autosub](https://github.com/agermanidis/autosub) for the awesome work!

Uses google speech to text API to convert speech to subtitle

## What's difference?

- Rewritten in python3
- Using google [speech_to_text](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs) client
- Extract functions to separate files
- introduce [moviepy](https://pypi.org/project/moviepy)

## Todos

- documentation
- provide original [autosub](https://github.com/agermanidis/autosub) functionality as possible as I can
- compose subtitle to video clip directly using [moviepy](https://pypi.org/project/moviepy)
- online version: maybe a aws ec2 instance or just use my raspberry pi
- custom google API Key setup (can choose restful or client)
- integrate Progress bar
- concurrency support (I think normal loop it's fast enough though)
